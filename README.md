## by Wrik Sen, Ayush Vora, and Max Xu
A full-stack project with a PHP/SQL backend and HTML/JS frontend. 
Created a schema for a relational database that runs on Oracle DBMS, and a frontend for users to access and modify the database.

### FrontEnd
****
<ins>Home Page</ins>

The image below shows an example usage of the home page that general users will use. This particular instance demonstrates a user requesting a list of galaxies with a size greater than 60,000.

<ins>Admin Page</ins>

The image below shows what the admin user page looks like. This allows admins to make changes to the database, including Adding, Updating, Removing, and Viewing all the data.

Here is an example of The entire Galaxy data table on the Oracle server that was used in the query from earlier, as seen on the admin page:

### BackEnd(Design)
****

For the backend, we first had to develop An ER diagram to visualize the relational database we would be creating:
